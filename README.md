# VanillaNN-Scratch

This is my attempt at making a Neural Network Architecture in Scratch. My aim is to implement a Neural Network and train it without using any external libraries. For this I will have to implement all the mathematical operations such as 

1. Forward and 
2. BackProp. 
and many other mathetmatical optimizations

Will also compare the performance and accuracy with a more standard way of constructing the 
same architecture using different libraries.
